# Cross-Regional Customer Service Chatbot

A multilingual AI Chatbot that incorporates NLP to offer personalised customer service for banking clients across various regions. This chatbot, once deployed, will be able to operate 24/7 and service clients from anywhere around the globe. It is capable of handling matters ranging from routine inquiries to transaction assistance.

## Problem Statement

In today's globalized economy, banks face the challenge of providing consistent, high-quality customer service across multiple regions and languages, while managing the expectations of clients who demand instant, round-the-clock support. Traditional customer service models struggle to meet these demands due to limitations in human resources, operational hours, and language capabilities. This results in delays, communication barriers, and customer dissatisfaction. A multilingual AI chatbot addresses these issues by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) to deliver personalized, efficient, and scalable customer service, ensuring that clients receive timely assistance regardless of their location or language. This solution not only enhances customer experience but also reduces operational costs and improves service availability.

## Project Description

The Cross-Regional Customer Service Chatbot will be hosted on Telegram to provide personalized banking support to clients worldwide. Developed using Python, Flask, and React, the chatbot is accessible 24/7, ensuring that customers receive immediate, high-quality service regardless of their location or time zone.

In addition to its core functionality, a comprehensive dashboard has been developed to monitor and log the chatbot's performance and overall customer experience. This dashboard enables real-time insights into customer interactions, helping banks optimize service delivery and continually improve the chatbot's effectiveness.
